# discourse-dice-comment

This plugin adds a **"주사위댓글 전용"** checkbox to the topic composer. When checked, the topic becomes dice only and normal replies are disabled.

Dice-only topics allow users to roll a random number as a reply using the **주사위** button. When enabling dice only, you may set the maximum dice value (default 100, minimum 0).
